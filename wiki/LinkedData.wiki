#summary How to get Linked Data from the SRU server.

= Introduction =

We are using this SRU server to deliver Linked Data for our [http://viaf.org VIAF] project.  That means that we support generic URIs for objects in our repository.  The generic URIs support content negotiation and suffixes can be added to the generic URI to pipeline the content negotiation.  We support a URI for the Real World Object version of the object, including doing 303 (see other) redirection to either the generic URI or to the RDF version of the object (based on content negotiation on the Real World Object URI.)


= Details =

The way the magic works is that I have a [http://tuckey.org/urlrewrite/ urlrewrite filter] in front of my server and when it see a URI, it pulls the record key out of the URI and reformulates an SRU search on that key.  It also adds a parm to the request to tell my server to strip off the SRU response wrapper from the response, returning the bare record.  It can also set another parm telling the server what content type to set in the response.
